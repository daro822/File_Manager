# File_Manager
This program is intended to manage local files. 
This program is intended to manage local files.

The program was written using the libraries tkinter and os. I created 2 classes named Interface and Manager. Interface brings together everything that concerns Graphical User Interface. It contains buttons that perform tasks such as: adding a new folder and file, changing their name, deleting, copying, as well as cutting and pasting. The manager is responsible for moving between directories and performing all functions that he receives from Interface. The App file creates instances of the above classes and runs the entire program.
